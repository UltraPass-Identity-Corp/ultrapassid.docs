# UltraPass Documentation

Welcome to the **UltraPass Docs**. This is your comprehensive guide to integrating with UltraPass—the platform that powers secure, scalable, and privacy-first identity solutions across industries.

## What is UltraPass?

UltraPass is a **Trust Platform and Identity Infrastructure Layer** delivered with US built technology, designed to help organizations rapidly deploy credential-based identity solutions using **verifiable credentials**, **decentralized identifiers (DIDs)**, and **biometrics**.

Verifiable credentials are cryptographically secure digital representations of claims—such as identity documents, diplomas, health records, or travel authorizations—that can be verified by any trusted party. UltraPass enables the creation, issuance, verification, and revocation of these credentials across ecosystems using open standards and protocols.
