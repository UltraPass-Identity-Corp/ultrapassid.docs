# UltraPass Portal

## Overview
The UltraPass Portal streamlines the management of your Organization's configurations and Products, ensuring a seamless administrative experience.

## Organizations
An Organization is an entity within UltraPass that includes a billing profile, domain, users, and product configurations. To extend an invitation to potential users, they must possess a valid email address associated with the Organization's domain.

### User Permissions
Authorized users are empowered to manage TrustLink Schemas, UAuth Identity Flows, and review platform logs and mertics; maintaining the integrity and functionality of the Organization's operations.

## API Keys
API Keys serve as a secure method of authenticating to the UltraPass APIs on behalf of an Organization. These keys are unique to each Organization and are essential for maintaining the security of transactions. API Keys can be found in the UltraPass Portal.

### Key Management
- **Confidentiality**: API Keys are sensitive and should be safeguarded with the utmost confidentiality.
- **Rotation Policy**: Frequent rotation of API Keys is recommended to enhance security. Organizations are equipped with a Primary and Secondary key, both of which can be rotated independently.
- **Usage**: To utilize an API Key, it must be included in the `x-upid-api-key` header for all requests.

Remember to adhere to these guidelines to ensure the security and efficiency of your Organization's operations.
